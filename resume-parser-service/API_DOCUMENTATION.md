## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Simplified API?**

All resume matching functionality has been **consolidated** into `/api/uploadResume`:
- âœ… **Automatic matching** against ALL job descriptions  
- âœ… **Best score calculation** and job recommendation
- âœ… **Complete parsing** and database storage
- âœ… **Comprehensive response** with all extracted data

**No need for separate matching endpoints** - everything happens automatically!

## Similarity Scoring Explained

### Overall Score Calculation
The overall score is a weighted combination of multiple similarity measures:

- **Overall Similarity (25%)**: TF-IDF cosine similarity between full texts
- **Weighted Similarity (25%)**: Weighted comparison of job components
- **Skill Match (30%)**: Percentage of required skills found in resume
- **Title Match (10%)**: Similarity between resume and job title
- **Requirements Match (10%)**: Similarity with specific requirements

### Match Categories
- **Excellent Match**: 80%+ similarity
- **Good Match**: 60-79% similarity  
- **Fair Match**: 40-59% similarity
- **Poor Match**: 20-39% similarity
- **No Match**: <20% similarity

### Skill Extraction
The system automatically extracts skills from both resume and job descriptions using a comprehensive keyword dictionary including:
- Programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Frameworks (Spring, React, Angular, etc.)
- Databases (SQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Development tools (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standardized error responses:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional error details if applicable"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request (invalid input, unsupported file type)
- `404`: Not Found (job description not found)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Example Usage with cURL

### Upload and process a resume (main endpoint):
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8081/api/uploadResume \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@resume.pdf'
```

### Upload a job description:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8081/api/matching/uploadJD \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@job_description.pdf' \
  -F 'title=Senior Java Developer' \
  -F 'company=TechCorp'
```

### Create a job description via JSON:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8081/api/matching/jobs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Senior Java Developer",
    "company": "TechCorp",
    "description": "Seeking experienced Java developer...",
    "requirements": "Java, Spring Boot, microservices",
    "location": "Remote"
  }'
```

## Application Health

Monitor application health using Spring Boot Actuator:
```http
GET /actuator/health
```

## Notes
- **Resume file restrictions**: PDF and DOC only
- **Job description files**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, RTF, TXT supported
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- The service automatically registers with Eureka server at startup
- In-memory SQLite database stores parsed resumes and job descriptions
- **Original resume files** are saved to `uploaded-resumes/` directory
- All similarity scores are returned as percentages (0-100)
- Resume processing is **comprehensive**: upload â†’ parse â†’ score â†’ save â†’ store file in one call
- **File downloads** available via `/api/resumes/{id}/download` endpoint
